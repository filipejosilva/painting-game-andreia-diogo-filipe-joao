# Painting Battle 

## Painting Battle is a game created during the Fullstack Bootcamp from CodeforAll_, Academia de Código, by:
- Andreia Ribeiro;
- Diogo Valentim;
- Filipe Silva;
- João Carvalho.

## How it works:
- You need to paint the biggest area using your keyboard (Up, Down, Right, and Left).
- Be careful to not collide with an AI Player. You will get dizzy and stop walking for some time.
- If you catch the wings, you have a bonus: increase your speed.

## How to play:
- Execute the jar file in the build folder.
- Good luck :)
